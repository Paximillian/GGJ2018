**Version 1.0**
Initial release.

**Version 1.1**
- Added methods that enable creating new pools in runtime (Useful for situations like card games, where you want to load pools only for cards in the players' decks).
- Added methods to check the existence of pools by their tag name, to work along with the aforementioned new feature.
- Added a new exception for the case that a new pool for the tag that you're trying to create already exists.
- Pooled objects are now childed to the pool that created them to keep the scene less messy.
